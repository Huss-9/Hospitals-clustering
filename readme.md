## **Hospital clustering**

---

This project was done in collaboration with peers in the data mining subject.
The purpose of the project was to understand the clustering method. In order to that,
we get a dataset related to covid-19. The dataset consisted of information related to
hospitals impacients, capacity and occupation numbers. The original dataset can be obtained
clicking [here](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/uqq2-txqb). We did the clustering and obtained 
three different classes: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severe covid incidence  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medium covid incidence  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low covid incidence
